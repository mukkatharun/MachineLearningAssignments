We still have many good, loyal,       straight-forward friends, whose memory we shall cherish, and when crooked       paths are made straight, and hard paths are made pleasant, the hope of the       retiring editor and owner of this paper is that he may be found among the       Vashon Maury Islanders, walking in such paths.  Wishing the greatest good fortune for       the News Record and for every resident of the Island. Respectfully, P.       Monroe Smock\n",

The       dietitian reports that 16 quarts are required for one meal so you can see       how many thousands we are going to need this winter, for the children       often have it twice a day. Another thing that we use a great deal of is       grape juice so if anyone is putting up grape juice maybe they will put up       a little extra for the hospital.        The cleft palate cases (and we have many) have nothing but orange       juice and grape juice for five days after an operation which makes them       rather expensive patients to feed.        It is a little early to be asking for the canned fruit but we need       it so badly and will be glad to get most any kind.  We have some jelly and jam which will last       until fall I think, but no fruit at all.        We have a great many empty jars if anyone wants to fill for       us.  Thank you for your kind       interest and hoping that you may be able to help us, I am very sincerely       yours, Olive Kerry, treasurer.\n",

Miller asked for nominations for president.  Mr. Norman Edson was nominated and       immediately asked for the floor and said “I do not choose to run.”  Mr. England was then nominated and the       nominations closed and the secretary instructed to cast the ballot for Mr.       England.  Under the heading of       “Business for the new year” the matter of better waiting rooms at the       Marion Street and Fauntleroy docks was introduced by Alex Stewart.  The matter of obtaining a better power       and light rate and more efficient telephone service was also placed on the       calendar of the Club.  Mr. spinning       then brought up that ever present ferry question, this time in connection       with the service at the south end of the Island.  It seems that the ferry company wishes       to discontinue the 11 o'clock service at night and also change the time of       the other ferries.  The Club instructed       the secretary to ask the public service commission for a hearing on the       subject.\n",
            "Editorial - The ferry       question is always with us.  This       time it is the south end ferry.        After enjoying the same schedule both summer and winter for the       past year and a half, it would seem only just that it be continued.  However at the present time the company       wants to take away the night boat and change the time of the rest so it       would make it impossible for one to live on the Island and work in       Tacoma.  Get busy with the       Commercial Club and make your protest loud and long.\n",

Counting the expense of       lighting, heating, janitor service, breakage and incidentals, it was found       that the charges were lower than the cost of operating, so that for most       of the functions the Club was actually out of pocket.  To guard against a deficit on this       account, the trustees adopted a policy of charging enough to meet the cost       of operation, with no profit to the Club, and which they submit should be       maintained if the affairs are to be managed on a business basis.  The new schedule is published elsewhere       in this issue. Besides the ordinary expenses, four dollars per month goes       for insurance and taxes.  The       treasurer’s statement shows the club is not running behind, but making       needed improvements.  While the men       quaff their coffee, they do not realize that the faithful women are       working away with half an equipment, there being on hand only about 60       setups.

Kirkland of the University of Washington. Prof. Kirkland gave many       interesting and instructive facts concerning this great problem. The plan       of reforestation is beneficial both from the standpoint of commercial       utility and also scenic beauty. The logged off land can be restored to a       mass of fine evergreen trees within 20 years or less. These trees can be       utilized by the pulp industry even before this time. Prof. Kirkland urged       that great care be exercised to prevent forest fires as these do       irreparable damage to the young trees.\n",

The object of forming       the Union was to unite the two towns and the two High Schools on the       island. Now we find this situation. What shall we call our one High       School? The football team of which we are justly proud played at Auburn       the other day, and tied that big school. The referee referred to them as       the Vashon High School team.

Burton’s ball and Burton’s off side and etcetera. Let's go ahead and do       what we wanted done. Let's have one High School in name as well as spirit.       Let's name the district. We don't care what, but give it some name. As it       is now the newest district in King County is trying to carry three names,       Burton, Vashon and Vashon-Maury.  We       suggest as a fitting name Island High School and the district itself to be       referred to as Island High School District U. Our argument for this choice       of names is that it distinctly fits. There is no other High School on an       Island in the County. Signed a subscriber and a school patron.\n",

The name \"Mid Bay\" seems to commend itself       for several reasons. In the first place it takes no recognition any       particular section of either Maury or Vashon districts. Second it is a       term which forces us to think beyond our own island and immediately       establishes a mental relationship with Seattle, Tacoma and the entire bay       country. Third the name \"Mid Bay\" lends itself to use in school       songs and yells because of the swing in saying or singing the name and       because of the combination of consonants and vowels and the possibilities       of rhyme. Even though this name may not be acceptable the suggestion may       enable someone to think of a better. Yours truly, Halsey Carstens.\n",

Shattuck, resident deputy sheriff, and two trustees.  – The foregoing new item, clipped from Tuesday’s Star, has caused a great deal  of comment locally.  The inconvenience of  the present system of taking care of offenders is so obvious that the officials  have decided that a local means of handling minor cases would be an economy,  and this decision apparently is meeting with the whole-hearted approval of the  majority.\n",

This provides two or three families with a public road.  And the biggest improvement along the line of  road building that has been made on the Island recently is the widening of the  road, just north of the Judd Creek bridge, where the Burton and Paradise Valley  roads meet.  Before the work is finished  not only will the grade to the north of the road be widened, but the high place  south of the road, which at present obscures a car coming from the south will  be leveled off.\n",
            "Let’s  Show The World – About a year ago the people of Vashon-Maury saw, and wisely,  the need of a Union high school, so they put their shoulders to the wheel and  by their vote showed that they intended to have one.  When the call for money to purchase and clear  the site was voted by the people, all of which has been done and paid for, and  water has been provided.  Now shall we  let this all lay idle with no further improvements?  We say “NO”.   Vashon-Maury needs the new building which will group the entire high  school in one building and we can show the world that we are keeping step with  time, and neighborhood communities.   Vashon at one time raised $1500 cash by popular subscription to make  necessary improvements in Kitsap County in order to get our present ferry  system.  Our new high school building is  not an idle dream, for by a little public spirit now, the graduation class of  1930 can graduate in the new building.   Two of the districts making up the union district have a bonded  indebtedness which would have to be lowered enough to give us a 3 per cent  bonding ability for the whole high school district, which would give us enough  bonds to build our first unit, with a capacity of 250 pupils.  If neither of these districts help themselves  at all, a matter of $1500 would clear the sheets enough for us to go ahead with  our new building.  The business men of  Vashon are staging another carnival, of which a large portion of the proceeds  are to go toward reducing this bonded indebtedness enough so that we can  build.  Let’s all get out and boost the  Carnival so that we can add another evidence of civic pride to our Islands and  show the world that we can meet an emergency. – Ira O.

            "Vashon  Pioneers Meet July 27 – In striking contrast to the present eight-cyclinder,  greased lightening, jazz methods of taking your “fun”, pause and ponder on the  manner of doing it thirty-five for forty years ago.  One of our young men, who lost his life a few  years ago in the line of police duty in Aberdeen, worked in a Maury Island  logging camp.  After the day’s work he  would put on his other shoes, walk down to the beach, row across Quartermaster  Harbor in an old flat-bottomed boat, and walk up to the Good Templar Hall at  Center.  After the meeting he would walk  home with his steady girl to Vermontville (now Glen Acres) and then walk and  row back home – a round trip of about fifteen miles and involving about six hours  hard work and two hours of play.  And he  was but one of many who earned our pleasure in the same manner.  Once each year the pioneers of Vashon take a  day off and get together for a good, old-fashioned time, picnic dinner, general  catch-as-catch-can pow wow, swap lies about the “good old times,” count the new  grand and great-grand children and speculate upon how and why the present  generation manage to exist under present day conditions.  The annual meeting of the Pioneer Society  will be held this year on Saturday, July 27th, and while it is naturally  expected that all the old timers here will be present, a goodly attendance is  expected of those who have moved to other parts.  – O.S.V.\n",

            "What Has  Become of the Band? – On July 12th, thirty-seven years ago, a brass  band of fourteen pieces was organized at Vashon Center and furnished more or  less sweet music on all festive occasions for the people of Vashon-Maury  Islands for a period of about seven years.   We had at that time about seventeen miles of road (to dignify it by that  name.)  Anything was a road that could be  negotiated by a one-horse rig.  The band  practiced once a week, frequently two or three times a week and the band boys  walked an average distance of three miles to band practice.  A nickle’s worth of gas and ten minutes time  would take almost any of our young men of today to band practice, but where is  the Vashon Band?  There are still living  eleven members of the old band organization, five of them still making their  homes in the finest place on earth to live, and they will all be present at the  Pioneer Society meeting on the 27th, to live over again for a few  brief hours some of the old days with old friends. – O.S.V.\n",

            "Our Traffic  Problems – A near-serious accident occurred in Vashon Wednesday afternoon, at  the corner by the hardware store.  A Ford  touring car coming around the corner struck the Urquhart roadster, damaging it  badly.  Instead of stopping and offering  aid, the driver after ascertaining that his own car was unhurt, tore off down  the pavement, not caring about the other car.   Fortunately none of the girls were injured.  Bystanders brought the driver of the Ford  back, but after much noisy conversation, he went his way.  On the Thompson road, west of the village is  an arterial highway sign.  To the east,  on the Beall road, the arterial highway sign that used to be there has  evaporated, or at least isn’t there.  It  is a common sight to see cars travelling along the ridge road, from Ellisport  to the ferry come around this corner at a tremendous speed, particularly on  Sunday afternoon.  We feel that the  recent tampering with signs is the work of our floating population, nevertheless  it is a serious matter, as well as poor advertising.  It has resulted in annoyance and discomfort  to several who are not familiar with the Island.  We have been informed that the penalty for  removing authorized road signs is one year in the penitentiary and $1,000  fine.  Apparently we have not developed  sufficiently to have state aid in the matter of our traffic problems, but we  are surely far enough up the scale of decent behavior to consider our  responsibility to others.\n",

            "Editorial  – The Need Of A Union High School – On Saturday of this week the people of  Maury and Lisabeula School Districts will go to the polls to show their will as  to the levying of a special tax for the purpose of reducing their indebtedness  to the point where it will be possible for the Union High School district to  vote on the question of raising money for the new building.  It has been brought to our attention that in  the case of the Maury directors a way was pointed out to them whereby they,  without consulting the taxpayers, could have diverted money from other channels  to take care of the payment of these bonds, but rather than to do this without  hearing the will of the people they are holding a special election, this giving  the patrons the chance to express themselves.   Blessings on such a school board.   The people of Maury district are surely to be congratulated on their  wisdom in choosing a body of men to handle their educational affairs that feel  a responsibility to the taxpayers.  That  we need a new high school building is a foregone conclusion.  Anyone with average intelligence can see that  we have outgrown our present facilities, that the manner in which the high  school was conducted last year was most unsatisfactory, due to no one’s  fault.  Our Island must keep pace with  the times if we hope to get our share of new residents.  The building of the new high school will add  less than two dollars per year to the taxes of the average property holder, and  the good of the young people is surely worth that much to anyone of us, even  though we do not have children of high school age.  The day of “Well, I got my education in the  little red school house, and they can do the same,” went out with the horse and  buggy as a means of rapid transit.  Where  is the man in our community that objects to good roads because they were paid  for by taxes?  We have all heard of the  debt of Maury and Lisabeula districts, that stand as a barrier in the way of  our voting the bonds for the new school.   The Business Men’s Club of Vashon this week placed in escrow $300.00 as  the nucleus for a fund to help out in reducing the balance of the debt.  By their approval the people of the two  districts will save money, as Mr. Thompson has so clearly explained.  No one denies that our taxes are high, but  the portion that is paid for maintenance of our schools is only one of the many  items that make for high taxes so let’s not be blinded for lack of facts.  With the unusual intelligence of the  people on the Island it will be criminal if  we fail our young people through the calamity howling of a certain class who  are not even well informed on the subject they talk about.  It is up to all of us, school board and  patrons alike to work hand in hand in putting over this big proposition.  We can do it only in proportion to the mutual  confidence we have in one another.  If  the school board is to receive the support of the people whose money they will  spend we urge that they treat us as intelligent, thinking individuals, taking  us into their confidence as far as it is possible.  The attitude of “the public be damned” is not  the proper one in this situation.  It is  our big community problem and an early solution is imperative.  The News-Record hopes to be able each week to  present different angles, for or against, this proposition as viewed by  representative citizens.  It will welcome  the opinion of any who care to express himself on the subject.  In past years the paper conducted a people’s  forum which had to be discontinued because of indulgence in personalities.  We have outgrown that period of adolescence  and are now mature enough to express ourselves sanely and safely.\n",

            "An  Invitation – The Vashon Island Golf Club Desires Ten More Active Members Who  Are Residents Of Vashon Island – Temporarily, memberships include playing  privileges without fees for adult members of a family.  What Has Been Accomplished – Seventy acres,  one of the most beautiful golf sites on the whole Pacific Coast, has in five  months been laid out under the supervision of the most noted golf architect in  the Northwest into an extremely attractive and sporty nine hole course.  All greens are in and doing splendidly.  All fairways except two have been cleared and  seeded, and only wait rains and a minimum of care to be in excellent playing  condition.  Three thousand feet of two  and four inch pipe, laterals to all greens and tees, reservoir and automatic  pumping plant have been installed; with adequate water to make the greens equal  to any, even in this climate of wonderful greens.   More than twelve hundred dollars worth of  grass seed has been put in the fairways and greens, and progress has been  without setback and as rapid as nature permits.   The cost of completing the two unfinished  fairways will be less than one thousand dollars.  The course is now open to members for driving  and putting practice, and a skilled professional is in charge, who is also  available to those desiring instruction whether members or not.  The addition at this time of ten new members  will care for all immediate needs of the Club and provide for upkeep during the  winter.  The land for this course has  been purchased at a reasonable figure upon extremely favorable terms and  protection provided for ultimate expansion to an 18-hole course.  There is no question but that the actual  opening of the course in the spring will see the Club, through green fees and  City memberships, in a sound financial condition.  The first fifty memberships are being sold  for $250, with a moderate down payment and he balance $20 per month.  It is not anticipated any dues will be  charged during the life of membership notes.   Each of these memberships includes a pro-rata ownership in the  Club.  Records compiled by Seattle  sporting goods dealers show the sale in that city of more than five thousand  beginner’s golf outfits during the past year.   With the opening of the full course in the spring there is no doubt of  the Club being able to obtain enough Seattle and Tacoma memberships to insure  stability and future enlargement.  It has  been found impossible to personally solicit all of those Islanders who may be  interested in this Vashon Island Project.   This is an invitation to visit the property, look over what has been  accomplished, and then if desired take up the matter of membership with the  Club President, Mr. E.H. Miller.  This  course will not be open to fee players who are permanent residents, except on  invitation of Club members.  The Club is  a member of the State Association, insuring courtesies from all Golf Clubs in  Washington.\n",

            "Dr.  Grandy Presents New Angle on Island High School Situation – The need for better  schools on the Island is evidenced by the fact that the people of the Island  have voted for consolidation of the High School and for the purchase of the  grounds for same.  It is realized that a  new High School is needed, and needed right away.  The plans which have been worked out by the  Commercial Club Committee, High School Board and architect seem to be entirely  feasible.  However, a new High School is  not all the Island needs.   Coming from a  Midwestern state, where consolidation of schools has been practiced for many  years, and where their merit is unquestioned, it was a great surprise to me to  find small one-room school houses still in existence, such as we have here on  the Island.  In order to give the  children the best educational training and contacts possible, we should not  only consolidate our High School but we should consolidate our grade schools at  the same time.  1. If possible, the  Island should under on School Board with representatives from the different  districts.  2. One modern grade building  at Burton, one at Vashon, and one at Maury Island to take care of the first six  grades.  3. An Intermediate High School  for the 7th, 8th and 9th grades.  This probably would take one or two  buildings.  4. One High School located at  Center.  With a plan of this kind, the  Burton High School Building could be used as in Intermediate High School.  This building is probably worth  $15,000-$20,000 at present, and is not entirely paid for yet, I  understand.  It will be a gross waste  unless this building is taken into the plans of the new school program and  utilized.  The transportation is a  problem here just the same as every place.   This has confronted every school board since the days of Consolidation  began, and has been solved so I am sure our School Board can solve our problem  here without any difficulty.  As soon as  possible, the School Board should put our teachers salary on a sliding scale,  so that their salary increased yearly, either by more education, more travel or  years of service.  Then the tendency for  all our good teachers with we get here will not be to drift into Seattle and  Tacoma.  According to the present plans  the taxes will be very little more, if as much as last year.  But if it costs twice as much, lets get our  schools up to the minute for the benefit of the children of the Island and for  the Future Vashon Island.  – Dr. Frank H.

Markham, a Methodist  preacher and missionary to the Indians, was born August 25, 1834, near Liberty,  Clay County, Missouri.  From the time he  was about 14 years old the care and management of their farm rested on the  shoulders of this boy, his father being absent from the home, preaching most of  the time.  In 1859 Mr. Markham was united  in marriage to Mary Jane Brownlee.  To  this union thirteen children were born, eight of whom remain to mourn the loss  of their father.  The family moved to  Oregon in 1874, where they lived until they came to their home on Vashon  Island, in 1883, where they have ever since lived, and where Mr. Markham passed  away on September 11th, at more than 95 years of age.  The history of the local Methodist Church is  inseparably linked with the life of Mr. Markham.  In April, 1884, the class was organized that  was the nucleus of the later church.  Of  the fifteen charter members eight of them were members of the Markham  family.  It was Mr. Markham who hauled  all of the logs except one for the little Log Church the cornerstone of which  was laid in May of 1885 and which was dedicated in November of the same  year.  Converted when only a lad of  fourteen, Mr. Markham was through life devoted to the church of his  father.  Interment was made in the Island  Cemetary.\n",
            "West  Side of Island Has Been Greatly Developed – Probably there are those who have  lived for some time on Vashon Island and are still unacquainted with the beauty  that exists in some other part of the Island than our own.  At this season of the year, when the forest  fires are laying waste to so many parts of our Island a trip to the West Side  makes one realize the splendid development that has been carried on there in  the past few years.  Just a short time  spent over there last Monday morning proved that there is at least one person  living in our midst who does not know even half of the resources of the Cove  district, bordering along just the road.   The W.W. Prigg ranch is fairly teeming with delicious fruit, with prunes  that make these raised east of the mountains taste like sponges by  comparison.  Last Monday was the bona  fide celebration of Mr. and Mrs. Prigg, and Mrs. Prigg was celebrating it by  canning fruit, and Mr. Prigg by doing just about the normal amount of work the  average man twenty years his junior could do, even though fifty years of life  together had just closed.  A call at the  Doyle and Ramquist – A fusion of flowers that are the rule everywhere in this  neighborhood.  Of course one hears often  of the beauties that Mr. and Mrs. Ramquist have developed out of what eleven  years ago was raw land, but if you have not already visited their home, do so  at once, and see for yourself.  You will  be perfectly welcome.  An abundance of  water has made possible a large swimming pool from the surplus from the  reservoir.  There is also another pool,  just for good measure, then on the lawn is still another fountain which feeds  the lily pool, with its lovely lilies in bloom, its gold fish, and the setting  of ornamental plants and shrubs.  And  flowers, vines, shrubs, and ornamental trees no matter in what direction one  may look.  Mrs. Ramquist says that when  they moved to the place eleven years ago they brought with them a scow load of  nursery stock, and now the effect is that it would take several to carry away  what has developed from the original stock, and each plant is growing where its  beauty shows to best advantage.  We  travel elsewhere to see many of the rare plants that are growing in the garden  not far from our very doors.  Many pass  this place, not realizing the beauty that is hidden by the hedge of trees along  the road, but the next time you pass the Ramquist home, take a few minutes to  see for yourself what these trees hike.\n",
            "Extensive  Building On Maury Island In Past Season – Scenic Beauty Of Maury Is Attracting  Investors – During the late summer, through the present time, and extending  apparently into the late fall, Maury Island is experiencing an unprecedented  building epidemic that indicates that that section of our Island is keeping  step with the times.  The loss of the  ferry into Des Moines for a time gave Maury a serious setback, but now progress  is being made rapidly.  The selection of  a part of the old Mileta farm as the location for the Vashon Island Golf Club’s  splendid course brought to the attention of even some of the older residents  the fact that for scenic beauty Maury is unsurpassed.  A volume could be written on the beauty spots  of this section of our Island.  During  the summer H. Carroll, well known Seattle jeweler, converted the old house, on  the Tokle place, which he had purchased in May, into an attractive modern  two-story dwelling.  This property is a  short distance from Fernheath.  Across  the Island, the Marx Brothers of Seattle, have built a large, modern summer  home on the waterfront lots which were formerly part of the old Kellogg  place.  W.W. Whitehead, manager of the  Tacoma branch, Fleischman’s Yeast company, has purchased waterfront lots a  short distance from Watseka Lodge and is planning on building a large modern  summer home.  This summer a large garage  was built which was used by the family during the season.  On the southwest part of the original Mileta  Farm, H.B. McPherson is building a fine large frame house.  Work is being pushed rapidly and when  completed Mr. McPherson will have a home that will be a credit to that part of  the Island which will be seen by visitors who come to enjoy the golf  course.  From the number of chicken  houses that are being built it would seem that the chicken industry is paying  on Maury.  The new chicken house being  built by S. Percy on the east end of the Mileta Farm tract is rapidly nearing  completion.  Jens Jensen is building a  large chicken house, while Matt Jensen is building a chicken house that even in  this community of modern poultry farms seems extraordinarily large.  William Duley recently completed a new barn  and chicken house.  Elmer Hancock will  begin work very soon on a chicken house.   Mr. Hancock has one of the finest locations imaginable, overlooking the  east pass.  Louis Isaacson recently  completed two additional units of his poultry plant.  Mr. Isaacson, we understand, is developing  his plant along plans that are original with him.  He already has two chicken houses of the same  type as those recently finished, also a greenhouse in which he raises the green  food the chickens require for the winter.   Each unit is entirely independent with concrete stoves in each for  brooding purposes.  The chickens are kept  in the same house from the time they are hatched until full maturity.  Last week a crew spent several days surveying  the old Land-Corbin gravel pit, which at one time was considered the best pit  on the Island, and the resources of which have never been exhausted.  From various indications, and interest in  adjacent property it would seem probably that there is a reason to hope that  this pit may again be put into operation.   With the development of Watseka Lodge, which has proven so popular  during its first season, and the interest awakened in this part of the Island  by the yacht clubs, both cities, it does not require a great deal of  imagination to picture the possibilities of Maury, and it means much to the  entire Island that these possibilities are being recognized.\n",

            "Raise  Old Glory Over Island Landmark – On last Thursday afternoon an event of more  than usual interest took place, the flag raising at the old Log Church, just  east of the Methodist Church at Vashon.   The schools of Vashon were dismissed early so that the children might  take part in the ceremony, which they did by singing the “Star Spangled Banner.”  A.T. Tjomsland, one of the Island’s older  settlers attached the flag which at the command of Charles England was raised  by Leonard F. Dearborn, a pioneer veteran of Seattle.  Mr. Dearborn, for whom Dearborn street,  Seattle, is named, has reached his 92nd year, is of Mayflower  lineage, and it was fortunate that one who has so long lived in the Northwest  should have been with us on that occasion.   Rev. O.F. Kreiger, of the College of Puget Sound, spoke of the  historical significance of the building, and the necessity of preserving it for  the future.  Despite the fact that Mr.  Kreiger had had little time to prepare what he was to say, he presented  forcibly to the young people present the importance of the spiritual elements  in our community life, and the need of honoring the traditions of the early  days on our Island.  One of the visitors,  J.E. Standly, had presented for the church grounds a beautifully wrought sun  dial.  This has been placed in front of  the building.  Mr. Standly is the  proprietor of the Old Curiosity Shop on Colman Dock.  The flag pole, 65 feet height, bears a brass  plate with an inscription, stating that it was presented to the old Log Church  by C.L. Garner.  The pole was erected by  the Puget Sound Power and Light crew.   Through this occasion the children of our community have been given an  opportunity to know of a portion of the early history when a modern school  system seemed very far off, and to realize, by contrast, just what rapid  strides have been made in our development.\n",
            "6 To 1  Vote In Favor Of High School Building – People Approve Special Levy For  Building Fund – The results of the school election last Saturday would indicate  to the most casual observer that the people of the Island were more than  lukewarm in their desire for the new high school.  While those most active in carrying on the  educational campaign before the election were moderately optimistic, they did  not dare to hope for anything like an almost 6 to 1 result, 403 for with only  69 against the proposition.  It is not to  be lost sight of that voting for the six mill levy is merely the preliminary  skirmish in our campaign for our new school, for in about a month another  election will be held to vote on the subject of the bond issue.  If this fails to meet with the approval of  the majority of our voters, the amount which will be realized from the six mill  levy will be placed in a building fund, and the new building relegated to the  future, which is not at all what we need.   Active work must continue, as it would be indeed unfortunate for the  movement to fail now as the result of too much confidence.  The committee requests that all pledges made  toward the school debt fund be paid to the Vashon State Bank not later than  next week, on September 25th.   It is important that this money be paid in at once.\n",
            "What Is  The Outcome To Be? – The various comments as to the manner in which our road  affairs are being conducted lead one to wonder what it is all about.  Under the previous administration the people  of the Island were in the main satisfied with the manner in which we were  allowed a voice in the local road building program and administration.  Even the man that our commissioner selected  when he found we could not, according to his judgment exercise proper  intelligence in making our own choice, could scarcely be considered more than a  figure head despite his ability and training for this work.  The administration is still young, and it may  be that the present plan will work out with benefit to al concerned.\n",

            "Johnny Walker       Comes To Grief – Sunday seemed to be the day for accidents on Vashon       Island, as elsewhere.  During the       afternoon a pile-up occurred on the highway between Vashon and       Center.  Chas. England, recently       arrived from Illinois, was turning into his brother’s driveway.  His signal was disregarded by the car       coming behind him, and as he turned he was struck with enough force to       tangle things up generally.  The       party of five in the second car were so shaken up that one woman had to be       given artificial respiration.  The       Island doctors were summoned to minister to the victims, but after a       little of the tumult and the shouting had subsided, observation revealed       that in addition to the members of the medical profession, our local       member of the law enforcement force ought also to be among those present,       and F.J. Shattuck was invited to the party.  He learned that, most suitably the       driver of the car bore the cognomen of Johnny Walker.  After getting the necessary data he       released the victims who were taken to Seattle hospitals.  What action the sheriff’s office has, or       will take in the matter has not been announced, but in face of the       condition of those in the car and the sundry bottles in evidence it would       seem that something should be done.        It seems that it is a poor policy for either the paper or       individuals on our Island to admit that we are without man-made traffic       laws, or the laws of common decency.        Without traffic officers we are at the mercy of the speed outlaws,       domestic and foreign varieties, which rob motoring on the Island of all of       its joys.  Fortunately there have       been only a few serious accidents, but this is due entirely to good       fortune, and not to the good sense of a large proportion of drivers.\n",

Burfield, manager of       the local theatre, in turning off of the highway, onto the Cove road, was       so preoccupied by thoughts of the big pictures he hopes soon to bring to       the Island, that he forgot to straighten out his car after he had made the       turn.  Or it is just possible that       he had planned on taking advantage of the opening of the hunting season       the next day, and seeing the flock of birds that live in the old Gilfillan       orchard, he may have decided to run them down, forgetting it was not yet       October 1st.  At any       rate, in true theatrical style, he plunged down the precipice (the bank),       skipped across the babbling brook, coming to a sudden halt under the old       apple tree.  Neither driver nor car       was any the worse for the experience, and drive unruffled, through the       orchard, and out into the sunset, undisturbed by the narrow escape.\n",

Roberts, in the matter, I was informed that the board of directors of the       Orthopedic organization had, sometime ago, adopted a policy whereby the       name of the hospital shall not be permissible when the proposition       involved private monetary gain.  To       be sure, any sensible person can see the logic of such a policy, and we       believe Mrs. Roberts is dead right in adhering to this rule to the       letter.  The secretary was kind to       our position, however, and granted honesty in our purpose.  But, contrary to Mrs. Roberts’ decision,       a false rumor has come to my notice which I wish to correct and       emphatically state, the show is sponsored by none other than the Vashon       Theatre management and Sovereign’s Greater Vodvil Co. – Lon Sovereign.\n",

            "A More or Less       True Story – Once upon a time a man was traveling through a deep forest.  Night found him far from human       habitation, so he took refuge in a hollow log.  Toward morning he wakened to find that       either he had expanded, or the log had shrunk, and he was caught       fast.  Finding that no amount of       struggling would avail, and feeling sure that a hideous death awaited him,       far from humankind, he began to review the events of his life.  He thought first of the good deeds he       had done, but the sense of his fate, together with the grey dawn made him       so morbid that his bad deeds seemed easier to review.  He thought over, one by one, of how he       had failed in his relations to his follow man.  He thought of how he had failed to pay       Dr. Grandy, the final payment on the last baby, of how he still owed Dr.       McMurray for the time he lanced that boil.        He had deliberately walked out of Tim’s Place without paying for a       cup of excellent coffee.  He had       exhausted his credit everywhere in Vashon, and had worked down the Island       as far as the Burton Trading store.        He owed England & Petersen for the sack of Petersen’s       Developing Mash that had developed him to his present proportions.  He suddenly remembered that one day he       had ridden on the bus and had told Bob that he would pay his fare that       evening, but instead he had asked a friend on the ferry for a ride home       that night, and had been flagging passing cars ever since.  Then too, there was the time he had gone       for some lumber, and finding neither Gus nor Don he had helped himself,       forgetting to mention it the next time he saw them.  As though this were not all bad enough       he remembered that he owed dues to every lodge on the Island, to his       church, the Commercial Club, the Boy Scouts and the Golf Club, not to       mention what he had promised to give toward the school debt.  By this time he felt that his life, so       marked by sins of omission, was indeed so debased that nothing remained       when finally another horrible thought popped into his mind.  For years he had read the       News-Record.  He remembered how he       had chuckled mightily as each little yellow slip came, notifying him that       he was in arrears, and that his remittance would be appreciated.  He had been mightily insulted when       finally the cruel editor had removed him from the list, but instead of       paying up he had borrowed the paper each week from his neighbor, getting       the news just the same.  Suddenly he       had a queer sensation.  He realized       that he could move.  He crawled out       of the log, inch by inch, emerging just as the sun rolled up over the hill       tops.  Did it feel good to be free       again?  You’re right , it did.  As the full realization of his escape       struck him he muttered, “Well, I didn’t know anything could make a fellow       feel so small.  I guess I’ll send a       check tomorrow for what I owe on the News-Record.” – With apologies to the       good minister from whom this story was borrowed.\n",

            "Building of the       Golf Course Told at Delightful Dinner – Last Saturday evening, at Watseka       Lodge, the Vashon Island Golf Club members, and their wives, staged their       first social event of the winter season, a dinner, followed by an evening       of bridge.  About thirty-five were       present.  President Miller reported       that the work on the course was now practically completed, and that all       that remained to be done was the weather man to turn on the rain so that       the grass could get a fair chance.        A caretaker is now installed, and with the continuous attention       that will be given by spring everything should be all ready for the season’s       games.  One of the experienced       players present made the statement that this was one of the “sportiest       courses in the state.”  The local       golf club is gaining a reputation throughout the fraternity for having       been formed of a group of people, a large percentage of whom were       non-players, but who possessed the vision to see what an asset to the       community a golf course would be.        It is a well-known fact, that thanks to the good management of       those in charge of the building of the course that Vashon Island has a       finer course, at half the cost, than many older organizations.  Although the club has gone through the       most trying period, and it remains now to enjoy the fruits of labor, there       are still memberships available.        Such a membership not only insures one of much good sport, but       provides also a means of entertaining one’s visitors, and is in many other       ways a splendid investment.\n",

            "On Wednesday       afternoon a bunch of such disreputable looking characters struck the       village of Vashon, that some course of drastic action seemed       necessary.  All bore a familiar       look, and some of the older citizens were inclined to think that Rip Van       Winkle history was being repeated.        One of the visitors insisted that he was John Metzenberg, but when       little Barbara refused to claim his as her handsome young father, much       doubt was expressed.  Another said       that his name was Zimmerman.  He was       escorted to the Zimmerman home south of the village, and feeling ran high       when the Zimmerman dog, an unusually intelligent animal, ran howling away       to hide.  The other two members of       the party claiming they bore the name of Tjomsland had slipped away during       the confusion, so it is not known what their reception was.  Surprising as it may seem, after a visit       to the barber shop, it developed that these men really were who they said       they were.  The hirsute adornment       behind which they had taken refuge was only the growth acquired while       pursing the three deer they had bagged during the past two weeks, over on       the east side of the mountains.\n",

            "To be No       Shortage of Power On Vashon Island – With the discussion of power shortage       in the two cities across the Sound it is only natural that many of the       patrons of the Puget Sound Power & Light Company here on the Island       should feel some concern.  We who       remember the periods of darkness seven or eight years ago have a kindred       feeling for those in danger of being deprived of electric power.  When questioned concerning any possible       danger here on the Island, C.L. Garner, local superintendent, stated that       there was no danger whatever of his company’s being unable to furnish       power, at the present in just the same manner as they had been furnishing       it all summer; that they had realized that water-power was not entirely       dependable as a source of electricity, and for this reason the company has       expended a large amount in building the giant Shuffleton plant at       Renton.  One unit is already in       operation, and capable of taking care of all deficiency of power, a second       is nearing completion, while a third is being installed.  The magnitude of this huge plant can       only be realized when seen.  It is       one of the commercial wonders of the northwest, and is well worth       travelling some distance to see.\n",

Sovereign, passing the F.A. Weiss home       discovered fire in the garage between the store and residence.  He informed the Weiss family, who were seated       in the living room, of what was taking place, then spread the alarm up       town.  He had some difficulty in       making W.D. Clark understand just what was happening, but after he did Mr.       Clark sent word to H.C. Cronander and John Metzenberg, who were attending       the picture show.  In due time the       fire truck arrived on the scene of action, and by means of it the fire was       kept well under control.  The       supposition is that the fire originated with the ignition switch in the       car, as the interior of the car was on fire when Mr. Sovereign discovered       it.  Had Mr. Weiss been willing to       let those who came to the rescue roll the car out, the garage could have       been saved, but he was afraid of a gasoline explosion, and figured that       lives were more valuable than garages.        While both sedan and garage are total wrecks, it is fortunate that       no greater damage resulted.  Had the       fire occurred two hours earlier, while the high wind was blowing directly       from the south, there can be little doubt that the Weiss home would have       caught fire. \n",

            "$21,000 Allowed       in Budget For Vashon Island Roads – The News-Record is in receipt of a       letter from W.B. Brinton, County Commissioner, giving in detail the       appropriations provided in the 1930 budget, which were requested by the       Roads Committee of the Commercial Club, for the improvement of Island       roads.  The amounts allowed in every       case were as requested by the committee with the exception of the “West       Side Vashon Island “ road.  The       amount requested was $2,000, and $10,000 was allowed for the improvement       of this road.  The Roads Committee,       composed of C.L. Garner, E.H. Miller, Maurice Dunsford, Theo Berry, Hubert       Spalding, A.H. Petersen, Zene Whittemore, Chas. Merry, C.M. Ruhlen and Coy       Meredith, have studied the needs of the Island, and outlined to the       commissioners the best manner in which the given amounts could be spent to       be of greatest benefit.  Mr.       Brinton’s letter follows:  “We have       been somewhat delayed in getting the information promised to the various       papers of the South District but we hope that the information contained in       our letter will still be of some value to readers of your paper.  In the budget of this year we have       succeeded in providing improvement of the following roads:  Marshall Armstrong road on the west side       of the Island is intended to connect up the Cedarhurst road with the       Corbin road, the location far enough down the hill to serve the people       living along the beach.   The Bates       road improved some years ago from the Tahlequah road down to Bates Landing       just north of Camp Sealth needs widening and provision made for the       parking of the numerous cars that visit this camp.  The Bedford is a short piece of road       which is provided for in our budget.        The Thompson-Wise road is a road serving some of the beach tracts just       south of Cove.  The Manzanita road       is the reopening of an old road closed for a great many years between       Dockton and Manzanita on Maury Island and would be justified for the       purpose of getting the school children of Manzanita to the Dockton school       if for no other reason.  The item in       the budget for the Rose Hills road is to improve the connection from the       camps at Rose Hills into the road that leads north to Dockton.  The two most important items in this       year’s budget for work on the Island are the relocation of the       Burton-Tahlequah and the relocation and improvement of the various west       side of the Island roads from the Cedarhurst road down to the connection       of the Priest road with the Tahlequah road.  This covers those roads included in the       Anderson petition and is much needed to serve the westerly portion of the       Island.  Those last two roads are in       the “Farm to Market” budget.\n",

            "Minor  Damages Done By High Wind Over Island Tuesday Night – The high wind on  Christmas Eve wrought havoc on the Island, as well as elsewhere.  In the past ten years this is the third and  worst wind storm that has visited us.   One wonders why the holiday should be celebrated in that particular  manner.  While nothing really tragic  occurred, several freak results have been reported.  The flag pole at the Vashon high school  building was blown down.  At the  Spaulding home at Cedarhurst two windows were blown in, pictures blown from the  wall, and general confusion reigned for a time.   In another West Side home the vibration of the house toppled over a  laden Christmas tree.  Over practically  all of the West Side the telephone service was out the greater part of the day,  while the Lisabeula district was without lights until 5 o’clock last  evening.  At the Collings home the garage  suffered severely, and is now standing at an angle.  It is reported that passersby rub their eyes  as they look at it and wonder if they are seeing things.  John King visited Vashon this morning, purchasing  glass to replace the windows blown in in his chicken houses.  The Fuller-Curtis greenhouses at Ellisport  suffered a loss of glass, as did greenhouses in several parts of the Island.  In all parts of the Island trees were  uprooted and large branches broken off, none however doing any great  damage.  A lad rowing from Salmon beach  finally drifted ashore at Shawnee and seeing no lights wandered up the shore  until he came to the house of Amos Cummings on the Peninsula.  He was taken to Dr. Young’s home and cared  for until morning.  One of the Peterson  tug boats of Dockton had a narrow escape.   They ran out of Diesel oil near Cedarhurst, while returning from  Seattle.  Help was sent from Dockton and  they succeeded in reaching the harbor before the storm broke.  Had they been a little later the beach  dwellers might have found a perfectly good boat in their front yards for a  Christmas present, for one perfectly dependable young man living down there on  the beach solemnly declares that the waves, about three o’clock were at least  twelve feet high.\n",

Shattuck Appointed Full-Time Deputy – With the appointment of F.J. Shattuck by  the county commissioners, taking effect January 1st, Vashon Island  now has a full time deputy sheriff.  For  the past five years Mr. Shattuck has served as part time deputy, receiving his  first appointment under Matt Starwich, later being reappointed by Claude G.  Bannick.  For several years citizens of  the Island have been requesting a full time deputy.  The growth of the population, and the  apparent need of some manner of adequate law enforcement, the matter has caused  real concern among the element desiring the best for the community.  Evidently the commissioners too realized the  need, and provided for it in the latest budget.   The first task that confronts Mr. Shattuck is his work in conjunction  with the state highway department in checking up on motor vehicle licenses and  irregularities.  Following this will be  the work of building the new jail at Vashon, which will be begun as soon as the  lease for the lot can be secured from Water District No. 19.  Contrary to the original plan of doing the  work with the aid of trustees from the county jail Mr. Shattuck will do the  work alone.  The building, made entirely  of reinforced concrete, is to be 12 by 18 feet in dimension, and will have two  cells, and an office.  At the side will  be a garage for the fire truck, and a shop in the rear, extending across the  end of the jail.  These will be of wooden  construction.  \n",

            "What  Price Maliciousness – The regrettable occurrence at the basketball game last  Friday night when persons connected with the student body, assisted, we understand  by others not in the high school, tampered with the cars of our visitors from  Black Diamond.  We cannot attribute what  happened to the thoughtlessness of youth, for the element of maliciousness was  too strongly evident.  The visiting teams  came here at the invitation of the school, reasonably expecting the courtesies  usually accorded guests.  They conducted  themselves in an orderly, well-behaved manner.   They were accorded flagrant discourtesy.   We are informed that the majority of the student body regret the affair,  realizing that through the acts of a few the school and community are gaining  an unsavory reputation.  The taxpayers  are building a new school, at a price representing some sacrifice to all of us.  By our response at the elections held in the  past few months we have indicated that we are willing to sacrifice for the  education of the boys and girls.  It is  only fair that our schools return to us conditions that are commensurate with  the investment that is being made.  One  of the greatest assets a community can posses is an up-to-the-minute, orderly,  law-respecting student body.  The  Commercial Club, and all civic bodies may spend time and money in interesting  prospective residents, and their efforts can be wiped out by a few acts of  lawlessness on the part of a few of our young people, lacking in a sense of  community pride.  It is not fair that our  community should gain an unenviable reputation at the hands of those whom one  of our correspondents has termed as “defective youth.”  We do not feel that the present attitude is  shared by a large percentage of those in our schools, but we do feel that the  correction of existent evils lies in their hands.  Moral suasion is as great a force today, as  it ever was, and our boys and girls can accomplish just about what they set out  to for the good of the community.  Our  debating team has made a splendid record; in competitive athletics we are  gaining a fine position; these results, however, will count of naught if along  with it the lawlessness of a few of our young is branding our community with an  unfavorable name.  Good sportsmanship,  learned on the athletic field will profit nothing, if with it are not learned  the lessons of respecting the other fellows’ rights and property, and of giving  value received for the advantages daily enjoyed.\n",

            "Island  School Bus Wrecked On S Curve Near Orting – Last Friday night, while returning  from the basketball game at Kapowsin, one of the school buses, driven by  Charlie Meyer, of Maury Island, failed to make the second turn of an S curve in  the highway near Orting and rolled down an embankment.  When the game was finished it was too late to  catch the south end ferry, and there was only a small margin to make the  midnight boat from Fauntleroy.  The fog  made driving difficult, and although the driver had been over the road several  times before, and felt fairly familiar with it he had forgotten this second curve,  at the bottom of a down grade.  Even  though he acted quickly and applied the brakes the bus skidded off of the  highway.  That the ten boys were not  severely injured was attributed to the fact that most of them were asleep, and  in a relaxed position.  Passing cars  picked up the boys and took the five that were the least injured to Sumner for  medical attention, while the three most badly hurt were taken to the hospital  at Puyallup.  Two of the boys escaped  injury.  Before the bus could be taken  out of the ditch the next day it had been stripped of batteries, fire  extinguisher, tools, etc.  Theft and  liability insurance will take care of damage of this nature, and the care of  the injured boys.  There was, however, no  insurance covering the damage to the car.   The top was entirely torn off, and the body considerably wrecked.  The cost of putting it into commission again  will amount to about three hundred and fifty dollars.\n",

            "The  Coming School Election – The keen interest in school affairs shown during the  past two years indicates plainly that Vashon-Maury Island is fully awake to the  needs of the times and willing to pay for what they feel is a necessity.  A few years ago the idea of a union high  school district was scouted at; when the union was voted on favorably by a  large majority the diehards said the Island could never get together on a site;  then we all held our breath until the bonds were voted.  Since then the idea of the two special levies  have worried no one.  With the actual  work of the building in progress we are taking a justifiable pride in our  accomplishments.  Next fall when our high  school pupils enter the doors of a fine, up-to-the-minute building we will be  more gratified with what we have done.   This has meant a tremendous lot of work, worry and sacrifice not alone  to the board, but to the committee of the Commercial Club to whom the weight of  credit should be given for conducting their campaign of education, without  which the voters would have been lost in the fog of suspicion and community  jealousies.  The tax-payers, already  ladened with taxes have risen to the occasion nobly and have expressed themselves  as ready to bear the financial burden.   The fact that the people have chosen so wisely their candidates, and  that men of sterling worth, and wise business judgment are willing to give of  time and experience, demonstrates that we have reached a point where the need  of best effort is realized.  During the  past year Island boards of education have learned the valuable lesson that  taxpayers do not sign on the dotted line without knowing what they are  doing.  The fact that a certain levy is  asked, without a proper confidence being established, does not assure an  affirmative vote.  We do not advocate  penurious dealings in school matters, but we do advocate unreservedly adherence  to good business policies in the operation of our schools.  Not that alone, but more spirit of  willingness to account to taxpayers for their stewardship is conducive to  closer harmony between boards of education and taxpayers.  Most of the candidates are too well known in  their districts to require comment.  If  they are not known personally first hand information is easy to obtain.  In making our choice let us not base it on  personal friendship, pleasing personality, nor whether the candidate has always  treated us with greatest tact.  Let us  rather weigh his qualifications as the man for the place, remembering that on  the intelligent, unbiased administration of our schools depends the education  of our boys and girls, and as free-thinking, broad-minded Americans this is to  us the paramount issue.\n",

            "Are the  Affairs of Our High School is a Shady Plight? – An Editorial – For months our  interest and attention has been centered on the new high school which Vashon  Island has so generously and wholeheartedly voted in favor of.  By our willingness to be taxed, by our free  offering of a thousand dollars, we have shown that we were anxious to provide  for our boys and girls educational facilities equal to other communities.  It has all been done in a remarkably fine  spirit, and yet now that the building is actually in the process of  construction there has risen an appalling wave of rumor, complaints, charges,  countercharges and what not.  Time and  again as a matter of expediency, while the matter of the high school was still  undecided, the News-Record has refrained from adverse comment, even incurring  criticism thereby, rather than do or say a single thing that might endanger the  success of the issue.  The present  situation, however, is a matter that cannot be ignored.  The bitterness and hard feelings being  engendered will prove ruinous to our Island and injure the purpose for which we  have united if allowed to go on.  Too  much hope has been centered on our high school as a means of binding us  together to let present conditions to go on if there is a chance to get them  straightened out.  If the charge that  inferior material and workmanship is going into the very foundation of our high  school then drastic action should be taken at once to remedy the  condition.  To start an investigation, is  the duty of any taxpayer that is qualified to judge honestly.  The high school is being built with our money  and we will be paying for it long after architect and contractor have received  their money.  If these charges are  unfounded, then let’s in all justice to everyone concerned, get them cleared up  and stop the everlasting talking and criticism.   The present state of affairs has been psychologically unavoidable, by  the attitude of the high school board that “the less the public knew, the  better.”  They contend that anyone was  welcome at their meetings which would have been fine had the taxpayers had the  knowledge of when these meetings were held.   The News-Record has at all times been willing to publish, gratis,  notices of school board meetings, but the only time this offer has been  accepted was when more money was needed.   We have been told by action and word that we were persona non grata at  certain meetings where the new high school was under discussion because we  might “let the public know more than they should.”  Then in the second place there has been  entirely too much discussion about what a “bargain” we were getting from everyone  connected with the building of the school, and being intelligent Americans we  know the portent of the word and have subconsciously come to think that if the  school were discussed so generally as a “bargain” that it must in truth be that  very thing;  consequently rumor is  endeavoring to nose out the “shoddy” in the bargain.  We are not so simple as to think that  artisans, or even teachers, are working on Vashon Island just for the pleasure  of laboring in our midst, and we have had so much discussion of that sort in  the past year that it has begun to pall.   No doubt the high school board has been honest in their endeavors, but  according to the opinion of many they have erred in judgment.  We have felt, and we believe justly so, that  their venture into the field of transportation was ill advised at the present  time.  We feel that as sound business  logic should be exercised in the administration of school affairs as in private  business.  The average business man, when  engaged in building a plant for which he must borrow much of the money does not  usually launch into a side venture that involves a considerable additional debt  and expenditure.  We feel that Prof.  Robertson was sincere but premature in his attempt to prove by his figures that  the board could save money by operating its own buses, and no doubt after our  high school was built and we had the opportunity for a breathing spell everyone  would have been glad to try the experiment, but it would seem that the present  was not the time to become involved in an expenditure of about $7,200 plus interest.  An interesting (?) phase of this question is  why these buses were not purchased from Island firms so that the commission on  them could not have in turn been used in paying their share for the new  building.  Various dealers have said they  were not approached and did not know that the board contemplated buying these  vehicles, while certain members of the board assert that they were spoken to  with more force than elegance when they requested prices from local firms.  By the same sign, but to a less degree, it  would seem that with so many things that our high school really needs we would  get along nicely without an electric clock reported to cost seven or eight  hundred dollars.  We would approve  heartily of the clock were we in a position to provide everything that goes  with it, but it would appear that it, like the $500 return switch called for in  the specifications made unnecessary by switches and fuses at the transformer,  could be dispensed with, and save the amount for something more utilitarian and  less ornamental, for instance, adequate equipment for the home economics  department.  The new high school IS our  business, we are paying for it, some of us a good deal more heavily than some  of the board members; we are the ones who will have to pay in the future for  any discrepancy today; if the board refuses to furnish us with the information  that will stop these rumors we are still the ones to pay the price, for we have  known too much of bitterness and dissention in the past to believe that we can  escape its effects.  An Island quarrel,  such as now seems to threaten us, would set us back twenty years.  Now is the time for the taxpayers to take a  businesslike attitude and interest in what is going on.  If there are those things transpiring that  might be justification for the rumors that are circulating some drastic action  should be taken to determine the truth.   Charges of maladministration should either be proven true and corrected,  or they should be proven false and forgotten.   Until this is done we are laying a foundation of distrust and suspicion  that will prove poor material upon which to build permanently the greatest  institution of a civilized community, our public schools.\n",

            "School  Bus Question Still a Live Issue – An Editorial – Our editorial of last week  caused considerable comment, pro and con, more, we admit, that we had  anticipated.  Judging from the number who  have phoned, called at the office, written, and stopped us on the street, we  have not met with entire disapproval.  We  regret the fact that many have injected the personal element into what we said,  and seem to feel that we were hitting at particular persons.  Several members of the school board, the  architect and at least one member of the educational committee of the  Commercial Club, resent the insinuation which they felt were implied; several  expressed satisfaction that particular persons were “getting just what they deserved”;  while still another group maintained that there was nothing personal in the  entire editorial, and that the only persons criticized were those who had  started rumors.  We retract nothing for  we feel now just as we did last week.  We  have had too much of comments and rumors, and we still maintain that it is high  time to get things ironed out and out of our systems.  As for our having cast a reflection upon any  one we just as stoutly aver today as we have during the past week that no  reflection was intended or implied.  On  last Saturday, on the occasion of the laying of the corner stone of the new  high school Mr. Silas Nelsen, architect, voiced bitter disapproval of the  article in the News-Record, branding it as “false, a mass of evil insinuations,  unfair to everyone concerned, etc.,” and concluded with the statement that  “that article is a reason a copy of the paper was not placed in this corner  stone today.”  Mr. Nelsen was exercising  his constitutional right in voicing his opinion of the paper and its editor,  and we have no desire to enter into a controversy with him.  In our issue of last week we inferred that it  had not been an easy matter to get information in regard to the progress of the  high school project.  Here is one of  several instances we might cite.  On  November 21st we wrote to Mr. Nelsen asking for more intelligible  descriptive information that we, unskilled in building terms, could give.  We publish herewith his reply of November 23,  1929:  “I have your letter of the 21st  requesting data on the plans, etc., of the new high school.  I shall be glad to furnish information from  time to time relative to the progress on the plans, site, building, etc., so  that the Island people will be informed on the progress of their new  school.  Will you kindly give me the date  on which you publish the paper and also the last date on which you receive  copy?  I shall be glad to give you  information covering the project from my first contact a year ago until its  completion in whatever length article you think appropriate starting next  week.  Would you be interested in  perspectives and plans for publication?”   We did not wait to reply by letter but phoned to Mr. Nelsen’s Tacoma  office, giving the information he desired as to date of publication, etc.  We were promised by a young lady in the  office that the article would be forthcoming for the next issue of the  paper.  We are still waiting for it.  On Tuesday night a special meeting was held  of the high school board, representatives of the Commercial Club, and others.  Although the editor was rather peremptorily  urged to be present, previous arrangements made it impossible to accept the  invitation.  We have it on good  authority, however, that the meeting was entirely harmonious, and that those  present were satisfied with the manner in which the project is going  forward.  Through a committee Mr. Nelsen  has requested space at some future date to publish facts and figures about the  high school.  This privilege is always  available to Mr. Nelsen or any citizen working for the common good of Vashon  Island.  We qualify this statement, not  with the high school in mind, however, by stating that the matter we will  publish must be of general news value, and not propaganda.  It is unnecessary for Mr. Nelsen, or any  member of high school board, or educational committee working for the promotion  of the high school, to ask permission to publish in the News-Record anything  that will give to the people of the Island the information they are so anxious  to obtain.  Our columns are open to them  at all time.  From the first the  News-Record has stood four square behind the movement for a new high school; we  have spent more time than anyone not familiar with newspaper work could  possibly realize; we have edited, typewritten, made understandable and readable  copy that has been sent in to the office, then published it over the name of  the sender; our work has been disrupted waiting for promised articles that  either never showed up or were so late they had to be set after the rest of the  paper was ready for the press; we have given free publicity to every movement  that even remotely affected the high school.   With all due modesty we state that had it not been for the support of  the News-Record the new high school would not have become a reality at this  time.  When Mr. Nelsen and the board of  education see fit to have the all-Island inspection day they are planning on  the News-Record will be as ready as in the past to give all available publicity  to the occasion.  In this connection it  is only fair to ourselves to state that meagerness of information given in the  past has been no fault of ours.  We have  been able to publish just what we could get, and in many cases we have had to  be mighty tenacious to get what we have had in the way of news stories on this  subject.  We feel that the many  discourtesies shown the paper have been due to ignorance of the manner in which  the press is usually treated in public projects of this sort, rather than to  intention.  Again in reference to our  editorial of last week; no one was accused of dishonestly; we cannot feel the  responsibility for what individuals may read into what we say.  We feel that the majority of our readers  possess ability to read what we said in the spirit in which it was  intended.  Although we were publicly  accused of a desire to precipitate an Island quarrel we deny the allegation,  and are convinced that the apathy, with the undercurrent of rumor, was much  more dangerous than the general clearing of the air which we feel will result.  The question of the school buses, raised in  last week’s issue is not closed.  We do  not subscribe to the theory that the bus question is ancient history in that  the buses are already purchased.  If the  school buses show a profit to the district then we should have them; if they do  not, that is still another matter.  We  admit that last summer was the time for a controversy on the bus subject, but  there are more years coming and more   buses on the market ready for purchase, so the issue is not dead.\n",

            "Chairman  of Educational Committee Denies Charges of Secret Actions of Board; Says  Suspicions Groundless – Editor News-Record:   In the last two issues of the News-Record there have appeared editorials  that have caused some interest and we find, with the majority of  public-spirited citizens, a larger degree of surprise.  There can be but little doubt that the  general public have been well informed at all times of the progress of the high  school movement and the policies of those who have borne the brunt of the  fight.  However your editorials have  aroused suspicions in the minds of some readers.  We want to take this opportunity to present  some facts which we hope will prove these suspicions groundless.  With reference to the insinuations that poor  material is being used in the construction of the building, I wish to say that  a competent inspector has been on the ground since the first concrete was  poured.  Furthermore, samples of the  concrete have passed the Building Laboratories Tests.  The lumber has passed certified inspection,  has been checked and double checked.   School authorities, architect and builder are using every precaution to  prevent the use of inferior material.  If  these facts are doubted, one only needs to go and see for yourself.  Your article refers to an eight-hundred  dollar clock.  Inquiry would reveal that  no such clock has been ordered by the Board.   Likewise, your reference to a “five-hundred dollar switch” is  misleading.  No such switch is  contemplated.  Your insinuation that the  Board has attempted to keep essential information from the people is  particularly regrettable.  The public has  been told repeatedly, thru the columns of your paper and at public meetings  that it is welcome at any and all meetings.   No inquirer has ever been denied the information that the Board meets  regularly the first Saturday night of each month.  Your issue of Nov. 14th, 1929,  makes reference to the announcement made by Mr. Stone urging the public to be present  at a meeting of the Board to be held at Burton High School, Nov. 16th.  Certainly you cannot plead ignorance of the  time and place of this meeting as a reason for your absence.  You refer to the work of the News-Record in  bringing about the building of the high school.   I would not minimize the importance of your work, but will say that I  have been proud to count your paper a factor in the success of this  undertaking.  I am frank to express my  surprise therefore at your willingness to give sudden ear to rumor and gossip  and to publish statements that can have no effect but to discredit the sincere,  efficient and unselfish efforts of your co-workers in this movement.  Because of my interest in this undertaking and  because of my position as chairman of the education committee of the Island  Commercial Club, I have attended virtually all Board meetings during the past  year.  I know the Board is doing its work  effectually and well.  I can only feel  that if your acquaintance with what has been done had been as intimated as  mine, your confidence would have been as great.   – Ira O.

            "Taxpayers  Losers More Than $1600 In District’s Operation of the Buses; Liability  Insurance Not Sufficient – An Editorial – With the necessity of intelligent  economy in every department of our high school administration a survey of the  transportation problem is both wise and timely, although a better time would  have been a year ago.  Figures obtained  from an authoritive source indicate that if there is a continuation of  operation of buses by the district over a territory that could be served by a  public utility company a loss amounting to approximately $1,670 must be  sustained annually.  In addition to this  annual loss the district must run the risk of tremendous damage suits in case  of any accident that might occur in the operation of the buses owned by the  district.  In considering the question of  transportation so many phases are involved, and so many angles present  themselves that require careful consideration.   It is not wisdom, therefore, to pass judgment until we have considered  wisely and well.  However, we cannot  escape the fact that statisticians, constantly studying transportation problems  have struck an average that it is folly to delude ourselves into thinking it  can be beaten by novices in the business.\n",

            "Vashon  Island’s New High School Is Latest Design – Build to Permit Future Expansion,  and To Comply With All Requirements of State Board of Education – by Silas E.  Nelsen, Architect – On March 15th the last of the various contracts  for the construction of your new high school was awarded by the Board, that was  the contract for the electrical work.   With the award of this contract it is now possible for the first time to  give you a complete description and total cost of your new high school  building.  The building can best be  visualized by comparing its plan to the letter Tee.  The head of the Tee, which runs parallel to  the county road, contains the offices and classrooms.  The leg of the Tee, extending away from the  road, contains the gymnasium, and at the extreme rear the boiler room.  The building is 234’3” across the front and  the head of the Tee is 60’ deep.  The  gymnasium wing is 92’ wide and extends back 52’.  The boiler room beyond this is 21’x 21’.  The second floor of the building occupies a  space about one-half the width across the front, being 115’3” wide.  Capacity – The building is designed to  accommodate 300 students when all class rooms, laboratories and study hall are  full to capacity but not assuming the class in the gymnasium or on the athletic  field.  Department – The building, as  planned, groups the various rooms by departments in order to simplify supervision  and make it possible in certain cases for one instructor to supervise two  rooms.  These departments are as  follows:  Administrative Department –  This department included the public office 10 x 15 feet with its supply room 7  x 12 feet, the principal’s office 8 x 13 feet with a fireproof vault  adjoining.  These offices are just to the  right of the main entrance.  To the left  of the main entrance has been provided a rest room and toilet for the lady  teachers and opening off the corridor is a toilet for the men teachers.  Commercial Department – This department is  located on the front of the building just to the east of the offices.  There is provided a typing room 23 x 33 feet  (this room opens into the principal’s office) and a bookkeeping room 22 x 29 feet,  the two rooms being separated by a glass partition, which thus permits  supervision by one instructor.  Adjoining  the bookkeeping room is a recitation room 22 x 29 feet that is available for  this department.  Manual Training  Department – This department is on the first floor on the east wing of the  building across the corridor from the commercial department.  It contains a woodworking shop 22 x 51 feet  providing ample space for the students’ benches and machine tools.  In addition there has been provided a small  tool storage room, a room for painting and varnishing and over these small  rooms ample storage space for lumber.   The floor of manual training department is concrete laid directly on the  ground, this preventing noise from being transmitted thru the building.  Domestic Science Department – The domestic  science department is located on the first floor to the west of main entrance  and includes a domestic science room 23 x 34 feet providing ample space for the  students’ cooking tables, sinks, etc.  Adjoining  this is a kitchenette which may be used both for demonstration purposed in  connection with the class work and as a kitchen for the preparation of  students’ lunches.  Opening off of this  kitchenette is a small dining room which will be used for class purposes in  connection with the domestic science department and which can also be used for  teachers’ dining room.  Adjoining the  domestic science room on the west and opening off of it is the sewing room 22 x  29 feet.  It is planned to use the  domestic science room and sewing room for cafeteria purposes during the lunch  hour.  Recitation Rooms – Three  recitation rooms for general class purposes are provided on the first floor of  the west wing, each being 22 x 29 feet.   Physical Training Department – This department includes a gymnasium with  a playing floor 50 x 75 feet, a stage on the east 20 feet deep and 44 feet long  with ample dressing rooms at each end and with a proscenium arch 36 feet wide,  bleachers on the west with a seating capacity of three hundred adults, and in  the space beneath the bleachers there have been provided the girls’ toilet  room, shower room, locker room and equipment room.  Built into the upper part of the bleachers is  a small fireproof projection room, which will permit the showing of motion  pictures.  On the opposite side below the  stage is the boys’ toilet room, shower, locker room, and equipment room.  A feature of the gymnasium is the wood block  floor which is to be made of Port Orford Vertical Grain Cedar Blocks 1 3/8  inches thick, laid in asphalt on a concrete slab.  When the gymnasium is used as an auditorium it  will be seated with portable chairs and by using the bleachers will seat nearly  one thousand people.  When used as a  gymnasium, portable bleachers may be placed on the stage which, with the  bleachers, will permit nearly five hundred people to view athletic games.  Space for the storage of these portable  bleachers is provided below the bleachers.   Science Department – The science department will be found on the second  floor at the west end of the building and includes a physics laboratory 25 x 31  feet and a chemistry laboratory 25 x 36 feet.   These laboratories are provided with ample storage space for chemicals  and equipment.  Study Hall and Library –  At the east end of the second floor will be found the study hall with space for  eighty-eight individual desks.  This  study hall is provided with a small stage 15 feet wide and 10 feet deep for use  during assemblies.  For assembly purposes,  with two in a seat, there will be provision for one hundred seventy six pupils.  Adjoining the study hall and separated from  it by a glass partition, which permits easy supervision, is a library 15 x 18  feet well lighted by a skylight.  The  library can be supervised by the same instructor supervising the study  hall.  Construction – The construction of  the building provides for masonry walls, with wood floors, partitions and  roof.  The exterior walls are faced with  select common brick laid in combination cement mortar.  The main portion of the building has walls 13  inches thick, the face brick being backed up with eight inches of interlocking  tile.  The gymnasium wing is of brick  veneer construction with the roof trusses carried on timber columns.  The walls, footings, etc., of the one story  portions are designed to accommodate a future second floor, should this be  desired.  The main entrance, which is the  most important feature on the exterior, is to be built of Walker-Wilkeson  sandstone.  A double wall is provided  between the corridors and class rooms.   In this wall space will be set individual lockers for the pupils.  They will be set flush with the wall of the  corridor and will be ventilated into the attic space, positive action being  assured by the ventilating fans.  This  space will also include the ventilating ducts for the room exhausts, the  teachers’ closets for each class room, and the various other built-in storage  cases required in the different rooms.   Electrical System – This system will include the light and power, public  telephone, time clock and program bells and the fire alarm system.  All wiring will be done in rigid conduit with  the exception of the clock, program and fire alarm systems.  The time clock, program bells and fire alarm  systems are to be wired by the present electrical contractor by the equipment  will be installed by the manufacturers of these products at a future date and  will represent the minimum requirements for a school of this type.  The total cost of the building  $57,038.92.  All work on the building  must be completed by August 15, 1930.   The plan of the building permits indefinite future expansion by the  addition of wings on both the east and west ends of the main portion, as well  as building a second story over the present one story portions.  In exterior appearance the building will be  extremely pleasing with its brick walls, tile roof and stone entrance.  No useless ornament has been applied, the  architect having gained his efforts through the skillful use of simple  materials.  The building will be one of  which you can be justly proud.\n",

            "A Step  In The Right Direction – This week plans were practically completed for the  formation of a Vashon Island Credit Association.  This step has been made necessary by the few  undesirables who do not have proper regard, and realization of just what credit  really means.  Our merchants have  extended credit, in the meantime having to meet the bills for goods sold, and  have had their kindness abused until in self defense they are forced to take a  united stand on refusing further credit to those who are habitually  delinquent.  If present plans are carried  out they will use the same credit system as used by the city stores.\n",
            "Maiden  Trip Of New Ferry Vashon Was Planned For Today – It was anticipated that the  first trip of the new ferry Vashon would be made some time today, but up to the  time of going to press the boat had not landed on the island.  Beyond a doubt, however, the new ferry will  be in use to handle the Memorial Day crowds of tourists.  While this morning’s P-I states that the new  ferry was made necessary because of increased travel on the Peninsula, Capt.  Anderson has made the statement on various occasions that the new ferry was  necessary because of the heavy traffic to Vashon Island during the summer  months.  This, of course is what the  loyal Islanders believe.\n",

Garner presided  over the meeting and presented a concise report on the request of various  communities and individuals for additional road construction, the merits in  every case being weighed carefully.  The  road coming in for most general discussion was the South End highway and all  present seemed of the opinion that the most logical location for this highway  was not the present one, but the old gulch survey that was abandoned during the  Frank Paul regime.  Enthusiasm was  expressed over the improvement of this road, and many logical and worth-while  views were expressed in favor of bending every effort toward improved  conditions on a north and south highway linking the ferry terminals at the two  ends of the Island.  Almost without  exception the opinion was that the future development of the Island depended on  this linking of the two docks representing Seattle and Tacoma.  Equally pertinent at the present time was the  consideration of dock conditions at the North End, as the replacement of the  present dock will soon be imperative.   The plan is a dock twice the width of the present one, extending farther  to the north and eliminating the turn at the bottom of the Heights hill.  The possibilities of a concrete bulkhead on  either side of the dock, filled by dredging was passed upon as representing too  great an expenditure, the road supervisor pointing out how concrete piers would  be more within reason and more logical in every respect.  At the conclusion of the meeting it was the  consensus of opinion that rather than attempt further road construction it would  be wisest to keep up the maintenance of the one hundred and eighty miles of  road now in existence in an adequate manner, and concentrate on the  construction and improvement of the south end of the north to south end  highway, and ask that at least $20,000 be put in next year’s budget for work on  the North End dock.\n",

Willliams, of Spokane.  Many changes have  taken place since Madrona Lodge, originally part of the old Chautauqua property  was taken over by Mrs. Pyle, and her husband, who passed away some five years  ago.  Seven years after the property was  purchased in 1912, Mr. and Mrs. Pyle had the original building torn down and  built the Lodge as it now stands.  Under  their management, assisted by Mr. and Mrs. Harry Lee, Madrona Lodge became one  of the most favorably known summer resorts of the Northwest.  Certain patrons, from all parts of the state,  came year after year to enjoy the wonderful hospitality of the  establishment.  With the death of her  husband, then later the death of her son, Mrs. Pyle has found the burden of  conducting the Lodge far too great, even with the capable help of Mrs. Lee, and  has several times considered allowing it to go into other hands.  It was not, however until last week that she  fully decided to take the step.  Madrona  Lodge will be under the management of Mrs. Anna Dickson, sister of Mr. Williams,  the new proprietor.  Mrs. Dickson has had  years of experience in catering to the public and anticipates continued success  under the new conditions.  The miniature  golf course built by Don Parker has proven surprisingly popular and every  effort will be made to attract patrons through its popularity, and excellence  of the service of the entire establishment.  \n",

Smith Favors Grade District Consolidation – A special election has been called  in School districts for the purpose of voting on the question of consolidating  these districts, said election to be held in the respective grade school  buildings on Monday, August 18 from 6 to 8 pm.   A good many arguments can be used in favor of such a move at this time  but there are three that to my mind override any number of arguments that can  be made against the project.  We must  erase all prejudice from our minds and ask ourselves whether consolidation is  good business or bad business for our district.   Personally, after canvassing the matter from every angle, I have become  convinced that it is good business.   First, because the combining of these two schools make it possible to  take the children out of a two story frame structure and put them in a  fire-proof brick building, such a building we could never hope to occupy in any  other way than by practically falling heir to it.  Second, the eight grades can be divided among  three teachers instead of two; a big advantage.   Third, I have become converted into the belief that the leven of consolidation  is working in the other districts comprising the old Union J group which, when  they come in, will eventually make it possible to have as fine a grade school  here as is found in the city and we should by all means take this first step to  this desired result.  Last, don’t forget  that failure to carry this election at this time may block consolidation for  many years to come and I am sure we do not want to shoulder that  responsibility.  – P.N.

            "Shell  Oil Company Enters Local Field – This week the 15,000 gallon storage tank  recently installed at the Williams Mill was filled with Shell “400” gas, and  the large warehouse rebuilt for the business they feel is bound to come to them  will be stocked with oils, greases, and all other Shell products by Digby and  Donald Williams who are the partners comprising the Shell Distributing Company  of Vashon Island.  Shell gas and other  Shell products will be distributed to all parts of the Island by a new tank  truck.  Already the pumping station at  “Happy Jack’s” place at Ellisport is doing a rushing business and  representatives of the Shell Company state that in the near future there will  be retail outlets in various parts of the Island to take care of the demand of  this popular product.  With the  popularity of Captain Dobbsy’s Happy Hour each week day morning between 8 and  9, and Rudy Seiger’s program every Monday evening between 8 and 9 the Shell  products have become too familiar to need any introduction.  That the field presented by Vashon-Maury  Island justifies the installation of this wholesale distributing station seems  logical to the Shell Company representatives after a survey of the  situation.  This move on the part of a  local company is welcomed by the many motorists who feel that the famous Shell  “400” Dry Gas is essential to their needs, and this opportunity to buy their  favorite kind of gas will keep many dollars on the Island that have previously  been spent elsewhere.\n",

            "Our  Political Policy – Recently we have been asked to state our position on the  candidates aspiring to various and sundry political offices.  When we took over the management of the  News-Record some twenty months ago one of the statements we made was that we  would keep the little paper out of politics while we were at the helm.  We felt that in a community made up of the  intelligent, thinking class of people found on the Island that it would be  presumption to attempt to influence them through the paper.  We have our own ideas as to how we,  personally, will vote, but every citizen on the Island has the personal  privilege of likewise deciding how he shall vote.  We have attempted to give fairly and without  prejudice news of the doing of the present incumbents.  Of the new office seekers we know no more  that our readers, having to form our opinions from press reports and  pre-election promises.  It is gratifying  to observe that this policy which we adopted many months ago is the one being  followed by many of the country weeklies.   The day of press high-binding and vote-getting by fair means or foul  seems to have passed, all of which constitutes the tribute of the weekly  newspapers to the intelligence of the American readers.\n",

            "Time was  that local consumers had the idea that the only good peaches produced in the  state came from the east of the mountains, but this theory has been exploded  this year by the marvelous fruit that is being grown right here.  The peaches produced on the Highland Park  ranch went like the proverbial hot cakes.   Mr. Morgan disposed of practically his entire crop locally.  One of the Seattle department stores used a  few boxes for experimental purposes in their canned foods department and have  asked for the entire next year’s output.   C.W. Kolstad, and experienced orchardist, felt that there was no reason  why Vashon Island should not produce good peaches, and three years ago last  November set out 100 Rochester peach trees on an acre of his little ranch south  of Center.  Soil and drainage conditions  in his orchard are ideal.  The trees have  had the best of care with the result that Mr. Kolstad is this year rewarded  with a splendid crop.  The 100 young  trees have yielded 350 boxes of fruit practically all of which has been  disposed of locally at a price higher than eastern Washington peaches are  bringing on the mainland.  Instead of  picking the fruit clean from the trees Mr. Kolstad picks only that which is  well ripened, thus the peaches he is marketing have the superior flavor of tree  ripening.  Vashon Island fruit has become  known through the superiority of its berries, but with the successful raising  of sour cherries, and now the enthusiasm of peach raising here it would seem  that the orchardist has a variety of choice.\n",

Sedolph Rudd and nine  members of his crew were asleep in the tiny forecastle when the “Orient” was  struck forward of the beam by the knife-like prow of the freighter.  Almost cut in two, the “Orient” filled  rapidly, and sank until her decks were awash.\n",

            "Big Game  October 31 – Star Back May be on Bench With Injury That May Keep Him Entirely  Out of Competition.  Chances of Victory  Over Buckley Very Good.  Game Set for  October 31st. – A determined team turned out for practice last  Tuesday after school the last turnout for the past week owing to the vacation  the last two days.  The cause of the  determination was the coming Buckley game.   Although Vashon is not faring so well in their class “A” league  campaign, they are determined to take Buckley’s scalp.  Football relationship was opened between the  two schools last season when Vashon defeated their rival by a 12 to 7 count.  Later in the season, they met again at Buckley’s  ground.  From this game Vashon returned  on the short end of a 13 to 6 count.  The  two teams seem to be about evenly matched and both will be fighting hard to  gain the advantage in the number of games won.   The spirit of the Vashon team is high.   They intend to down Buckley even if they close call their contests.  Coach Schunke’s main worries are in about two  quarters:  1. Joe Green, flashy back, who  had his shoulder injured in the opening game at Highline still has  trouble.  The injured member may not be  able to take much part in the Buckley contest.   2. The line has not been holding with the consistency that it  should.  This latter deficiency has been  getting less in each game and will probably be fairly well ironed out by game  time.  Coach Schunke drove his team  through a signal drill and light scrimmage this week in preparation for the  coming event.  One reason why the team  did not do better against Enumclaw was because the fans did not turn out to  root for them!  Let’s make this Buckley  game of October 31, and all island affair.   Turn out and yell your head off for Vashon.  A team cannot play its best without  support.  Let’s all go.\n",

            "This  Question Must Be Settled – Although a large majority of the local public is in  ignorance of its existence a heated controversy is raging in our midst.  With the present state of affairs, with the  stock markets uncertain; with skirts growing daily longer, and the days growing  daily shorter; with hard times getting harder; with even the waters of Puget  Sound showing a lack of constancy, this matter must be settled.  Were it the lower class alone that is  involved it would be bad enough, but even our professional men seem to be  embroiled in this war of opinion.  It  hardly seems necessary to state that even the inhabitants of the deep are  involved, for the question is, no less – What is the proper way to smoke  salmon?  There seems to be one point  which these smokers agree, and that is that you should smoke only the big ones,  ten, twelve or fifteen pounders.  Another  point of agreement is that with the present low price of the fish that smoked  salmon should form a large part of the diet of us Islanders this winter.  Comes forth that legal light, Alex Stewart  and says: - “Smoke only the big dog salmon, ten, pounds or heavier.  Salt for twelve to eighteen hours, then slime  or wash the fish in their own brine; use no water.  Hang up to drip a short time, then smoke for  about three days, ending with a good hot smoke if you wish a good kippering,  ready to eat.  Use green alder wood.  In cutting the fish divide in halves and  don’t disturb the dorsal.”  Now comes an  expert that should be qualified to throw light on any subject, for he has been  at it for many years.  Keeper of the Lights,  W.S. Denny tells us that the proper way to smoke salmon is thusly: - “Prepare  heavy fish by splitting down back, take out the backbone, except about three  inches near the tail, remove “insides”, wash, and salt heavy with half ground  salt.  Leave in salt 3 or 4 hours,  according to size of fish.  Spread out by  placing sticks across.  Hang up and let  drain over night.  Place in a slow fire  of beach or dry alder wood and avoid as little heat as possible, hanging up by  strings drawn through the fish near the tail, where backbone was not taken  out.  Avoid hot fire, or meat will slough  out of the skin.  Remember, if success is  to crown your efforts the caudle must be left undisturbed.”  It is altogether probable that there are any  number of unexpected salmon smoking experts on the Island who can throw light  on this ancient and accepted subject.  We  have heard the rumor that Phil Greene possesses deep knowledge; the Coy  Meredith can offer some suggestions; the Old Man Edson has illustrations that  will help settle the question; that Tim Clark is an authority; that Theo Berry  knows a man that can beat the world smoking salmon; that Ollie Van is working  on a model of a new type of smoke house; that C.L. Garner has referred the  matter to old Peter Puget himself;  that  Elmer Harmeling has taken up spiritualism so that he can get first hand information  from Pilchuck Julia herself; that a salmon-smoking arts course in our new high  school; etc., etc.  Be this as it may, no  matter whether you favor the caudle, dorsal or pectoral method, this matter  must be settled as soon as we get the election out of the way!\n",

Sasaki, leader  of one of Seattle’s choirs, acting as master of ceremonies and  interpreter.  Mrs. N. Hoshi spoke in her  native tongue, and Tom Yoshimura, a graduate of the Vashon school, spoke in  behalf of the American-born Japanese.   Most delightfully surprising were the two groups of native dances, the  first by a group of grammar school girls, and the second by a group of high  school girls.  Music for these dances was  furnished by Mrs. U.

            "High  School Play Well Presented – A large and enthusiastic audience last Friday  evening greeted the all-school cast which presented the first play to be given  in the new high school.  Many were the  laughs provoked by the irrepressible Patsy, (the part taken by Margaret  Peterson), although equally side-splitting was the realistic weeping of her  mother, as portrayed by Mary Snell.  One  could almost hear the tears splash.  The  entire play was well presented, and the characters taken in a remarkably fine  manner, despite the youth of the actors.   The flowers presented to Miss Lawen, at the close of the performance by  the cast, were but a small token of the verbal flowers tendered her in praise  of her good work with the students.  “The  Patsy”, according to the sentiment expressed by many in the audience was the  best performance that has been given on the Island.  The new curtain and stage equipment added  much to the effectiveness of the play, and are surely an incentive to hard work  on the part of the student body to get them paid for.\n",
            "Night  School – At a recent meeting of those interested in establishing a night school  the subject was gone over carefully and discussed from every angle.  It was decided to petition the high school  board to establish such a school.  The  following courses of study were chosen as being the most practical to offer for  the first year, namely business essentials, English, typing, public speaking,  review of common branches and citizenship.   The registration fee will be $2.00 per person for the eight weeks  course.\n",

            "Patrons  of Tim’s Place need not be alarmed at Tim’s absence from the store.  He is not really ill, merely suffering from  an exaggerated case of golf fever, that will probably not prove fatal.  While Tim is in search of health and  happiness in the wide open spaces of Maury Island, Irene is dispensing coffee  to tired business men, and gifts to frenzied shoppers.\n",
            "Association  Acts Quickly – Considerable favorable comment was made concerning the prompt  and efficient manner in which the Northwest Automobile Association handled the  interests of their client in last week’s fatal automobile accident.  Jack Collier, local representative was on the  scene within ten minutes, a complete investigation was made and ambulance  service to a Seattle hospital provided for on the first boat reaching the  Island.  The following day a check was in  the hands of the family of the assured.   While money cannot pay for the loss of a human life it does help to  relieve some of the worries that lack of it causes.\n",

            "Steal  Proceeds Of Benefit Dance – Last Saturday evening the little community of  Dockton was given a taste of outlawry that sounds like the mainland.  A dance given to raise funds to improve the  Dockton Community Hall, the building in which residents of the little village  spend so many happy hours in community gatherings, was particularly well  attended.  The building is in need of re-shingling,  and the news that proceeds from the affair would go for this purpose brought  out an even larger crown than usual.  At  the close of the evening’s enjoyment everyone with the exception of Mr. and  Mrs. A.J. Stuckey had gone home.  Mrs.  Stuckey’s purse, with the proceeds of the evening was lying on a table, when  suddenly the light switch was pulled and a man dashed into the hall, snatched  up the purse, and escaped in a Ford roadster that was waiting.  The whole thing happened so utterly without  warning that there was no possibility of recognizing the perpetrator of the  outrage.\n",
            "Vashon  Island Again Represented – As we read of the delight of the throngs who visited  the newly decorated County-City Building, when it was opened to the public last  Sunday we were glad that Vashon Island had a part in the beauty of the  decorations.  When the offices of the  mayor of Seattle were being planned for, Norman Edson was approached by the  firm doing the work, and asked about furnishing two large pictures.  He was requested to appear with samples and  suggestions, but being too busy with Christmas work he replied that he could  not appear before them “in person”, but that if they were interested they could  go to a certain art store in Seattle, select the subjects they most fancied and  he would deliver the pictures on time, even though the time limit was rather  short.  Much to his surprise he was given  the order in preference to several Seattle artists who were eager for it.  The pictures, five feet long by thirty inches  wide, were finished in record time, and will delight the hundreds who  constantly visit the offices of his honor, the mayor.\n",
            "Burton  Again Has Outdoor Christmas Tree – Again Burton has come to the fore with a  huge Christmas tree, to emphasize the fact that that village believes in  showing the proper Yuletide spirit.  This  is the third year that a brilliantly lighted tree has graced the square in  Burton.  With its multi-colored lights  the tree can be seen for a long way, from the hill back of Burton, from the  north, and particularly from the dock, as the Tacoma boats land.  The tree is a testimonial of the spirit  constantly displayed by the Burton Improvement Club who are responsible for its  erection and decoration.  This club is  wide-awake and aggressive and does not overlook any opportunity for keeping  Burton in the foreground.  It is hoped  that next year there may be many such outdoor Christmas trees in the various  communities, following the custom that is being almost universally established.\n",
            "Unique  Christmas Decorations – One of the most unique Christmas decorations on the  Island is that of the two large holly trees in front of the Presbyterian church  at Vashon.  The custom of decorating  these two trees with strings of bright lights was established by Rev. Hugh  Armstrong, about five years ago, and has been following each year since.  Each year the holly trees are growing larger  and present a lovelier sight.  It is  doubtful if he who planted the trees originally thought, as he did it of the  pleasure they would give each year to all who passed by the church at Christmas  time.\n",

            "A  dance was held at the Dockton Community Hall last Saturday night for the  purpose of raising money to re-shingle the building, but evidently some person  or persons decided they needed the money worse than the hall needed a new  roof.  After the dance was over the  lights were switched out and the proceeds, amounting to over $40 was stolen.  The residents of Dockton feel that every  effort should be made to apprehend the guilty persons.\n",
